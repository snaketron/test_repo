\title{IGHV gene family usage in vaccine-challenged B-cell repertoires 
(SummarizedExperiment object)}

\description{
A small example database subset from study evaluating vaccine-induced changes in
B-cell populations publicly provided by R-package alakazam (version 0.2.11). It
contains IGHV gene family usage, reported in four B-cell populations (samples
IgM, IgD, IgG and IgA) across two timepoints (conditions = -1 hour and +7 days).
}

\usage{data("Ig_SE")}

\format{
  A SummarizedExperiment object with 1) assay data (rows = gene name, 
  columns = repertoires) and 2) column data.frame in which the sample names
  and the corresponding biological condition labels are noted.
