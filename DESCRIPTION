Description: Detection of biases in immunoglobulin (Ig) gene usage between 
    adaptive immune repertoires that belong to different biological conditions 
    is an important task in immune repertoire profiling. IgGeneUsage detects 
    aberrant Ig gene usage using probabilistic model which is analyzed 
    computationally by Bayes inference.
